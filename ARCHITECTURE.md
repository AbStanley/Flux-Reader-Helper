# High-Level Architecture: The "Self-Hosted Cloud"

This project is architected as a **Personal Cloud Platform**. It is designed to run entirely on the user's local machine (or a private server) while offering a cloud-like experience (API persistence, AI services) to the frontend.

## 🏗️ System Overview

    subgraph "Backend Layer (NestJS)"

    participant UI as Frontend (React)
    participant Nest as Backend (NestJS)
    participant AI as Ollama (Local)

    Note over UI,AI: User clicks "Explain"
    
    UI->>Nest: POST /api/generate { prompt: "...", stream: true }
    
    Nest->>AI: Call Ollama API (Stream mode)
    
    loop Every Chunk Generated
        AI-->>Nest: "Word"
        Note right of Nest: Controller receives AsyncIterator chunk
        Nest-->>UI: Write to Response Stream (NDJSON)
    end
    
    UI->>UI: Transport parses chunk & updates Text on screen
    
    AI-->>Nest: Done
    Nest-->>UI: End Response
```

## 🧩 Components

### 1. Monorepo Structure
We use **NPM Workspaces** to manage multiple applications in a single repository.
-   `apps/client`: The Frontend application (Vite + React).
-   `apps/server`: The Backend API (NestJS).

### 2. Apps

#### **Client (`@reader-helper/client`)**
-   **Unexpected Design**: It thinks it's talking to a real cloud API, but it's just `localhost:3000`.
-   **Tech**: React 19, Tailwind, Zustand, Lucide React.
-   **Responsibility**: User Interface, Tokenization of text, Audio Playback.

#### **Server (`@reader-helper/server`)**
-   **The Brain**: Centralizes logic that requires persistence or heavy compute access.
-   **Tech**: NestJS, Prisma ORM, Express.
-   **Responsibility**:
    -   **Persistence**: Saves "Words", "Decks", and "User Progress" to Postgres.
    -   **AI Proxying**: Hides the complexity of Ollama. Checks logic, logs usage, and streams responses back to the client.
    -   **CORS**: Handles security policies for the frontend.

### 3. Data & AI

#### **PostgreSQL**
-   **Role**: Primary Source of Truth.
-   **Access**: Through Prisma ORM only.

#### **Ollama**
-   **Role**: The Intelligence Engine.
-   **Access**: Hidden behind the NestJS Proxy. The frontend *never* talks to Ollama directly. This allows us to swap Ollama for OpenAI/Anthropic in the future without updating the client.
